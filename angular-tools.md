## [ngrev](https://github.com/ng-ast/ngrev)
Graphical tool for reverse engineering of Angular projects. It allows you to navigate in the structure of your application and observe the relationship between the different modules, providers, and directives. The tool performs static code analysis which means that you don't have to run your application in order to use it.
## [source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer/blob/master/README.md)
Analyze and debug JavaScript (or Sass or LESS) code bloat through source maps.
The source map explorer determines which file each byte in your minified code came from. It shows you a treemap visualization to help you debug where all the code is coming from.
